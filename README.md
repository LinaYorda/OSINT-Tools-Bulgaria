<i>I have created a list of OSINT tools that can be useful when doing your investigations. Though most of them have an English version, a basic knowledge of Bulgarian is required. Google and website dorking with these tools is highly beneficial and recommended. Alternatively, you can use Google translate. A word regarding the government's public data in Bulgaria - most of the registers are not electronically available, and those that are - are not fully updated. I also added non-government portals. Want me to include something? Make a pull request.</i>
